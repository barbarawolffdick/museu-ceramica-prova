# museu-ceramica-prova
Now that I am in my 30's, I got back to school and started to _formally_ study Computer Science. This is an exercise about good old web design. I used Foundation to build a quick mock for a Museum Web Site. The guidelines follow what the teacher asked me to do.
Got an A heh :)
